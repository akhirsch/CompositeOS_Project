If you just downloaded the source code, and wish to run Composite on
your system, you must follow these steps:

1) Get a linux 2.6.33 kernel running on your system.  Composite should
work on other systems, but this is the version I've tested on.

2) Patch your kernel with the patch in src/platform/linux/patches/.

3) (Optional:) Patch your kernel with kdb, the kernel debugger.

4) When setting up your kernel (e.g. make menuconfig), make note of
the timer tick frequency.  Modify the
kernel/include/shared/cos_config.h file with your timer frequency AND
update the config file with the GHZ of your machine.

5) When your new kernel is working, save the directory that all of
your kernel's header files are in.  I'll call this LINUX_DIR.  I'll
call the directory that the Composite source is rooted in
COMPOSITE_DIR.  You must also choose two additional directories: 1)
the temporary directory all components are copied to, and 2) the
directory you will use as root to run Composite in.  Open the file
src/Makefile.src and change the following lines:

# the directory this file is in
TOP_DIR=/home/gparmer/research/composite/src/
# the directory the linux source is in
LDIR=/home/gparmer/research/linux-2.6.33
# the directory all objects will be copied to when they are ready for
# deployment
TRANS_DIR=/home/gparmer/transfer
# the directory that root can access that the objects are copied to
# where the experiments are run from
TEST_DIR=/root/experiments/

to

# the directory this file is in
TOP_DIR=COMPOSITE_DIR
# the directory the linux source is in
LDIR=LINUX_DIR
# the directory all objects will be copied to when they are ready for
# deployment
TRANS_DIR=/home/gparmer/transfer
# the directory that root can access that the objects are copied to
# where the experiments are run from
TEST_DIR=/root/experiments/

where COMPOSITE_DIR and LINUX_DIR refer to your real directories
specified as absolute paths, and /home/gparmer/transfer should be your
temporary directory, and /root/experiments should be your root
execution directory.

Now you should be able to build and execute the source!  Read about
the build system in build_system.txt.  Summary:

make init # in src/
make
make cp

As root in your root execution directory:
make init
make
sh lpp.sh

Whenever you want to execute the system again:

make
sh lpp.sh
